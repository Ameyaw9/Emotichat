## Problem Statement

### Hackathon Challenge: Problem Statement 1 â€“ Peace with Oneself

Emotional distress from unresolved trauma often manifests as repeated patterns that undermine individual well-being and erode community cohesion. Despite growing awareness of trauma's impact, there is a lack of accessible, holistic, and personalized tools that can proactively identify emotional wounds and guide users through healing journeys.
